This repo uses the CapacitiveSensor library to read the values of a capacitive slider that I plan to incorporate into a metal leaf tattoo. 
The slider is made out of 2 seperate pads that have a diagonal slit between them. As you run your finger through the slider across the slit, the area of the finger on the sensors change,
changing the capacitance of your finger which can be read by the library.
Then, you simply take the ratio between the readings to get your positition of the slider.
